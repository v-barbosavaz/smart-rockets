# Smart rockets

Implementation of smart rockets (see project [here](http://blog.blprnt.com/blog/blprnt/project-smart-rockets) and [here](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/029-smartrockets.html)) in functional programming in Scala.

Note: code is not totally written in pure functional programming, I am still learning the paradigms behind it.
